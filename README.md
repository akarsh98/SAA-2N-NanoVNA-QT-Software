In this project, we are going to test the Antennas that we use in our projects. Antennas are the main part of any communication System and without a good antenna a communication system cannot work efficiently. If you are facing a problem such as low range or no communication between two devices in your project, Then it is possible that problem is with your Antenna and when we talk about the applications such as Helium Mining etc, then the importance of a good antenna becomes more prominent

For the Antenna testing process, we have with us an SAA-2N NanoVNA. A VNA is a Vector Network Analyzer which is like an oscilloscope but is different. It is used to study the behaviour of RF signals and is a very important tool for component and Circuit Testing. The NanoVNA that we have today is battery operated and compact. It has a built in diaplay and a USB Port as well through which it can be connected to a PC making it a PC based Spectrum Analyzer.

While testing the Antennas what we will do is that, we will first of all connect the Antenna to the NanoVNA and as the Antenna is connected, the curve showing the Antenna SWR will come up on the Screen as we have confiured the VNA to do so. After the curve comes up on the screen we will see that there are points at which the curve comes at a dip. These are the points for which the antenna is supposed to perform its best. The lower the dip, the more closer SWR will be to 1 and the more efficient the antenna will be so on the basis of this parameter we will compare the Antennas by comparing their SWR and at the end we will get the best Antenna with us.
